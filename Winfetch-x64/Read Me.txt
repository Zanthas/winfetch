HOW TO USE:
Unzip this archive into your home folder and paste it there.
Edit the .bat to reflect directory where you want the screenshot to be. (nircmd.exe savescreenshotfull c:/path/to/file/goes/here/Screenshot-Winfetch%.png)
Open the Command Prompt.
type winfetch
You're Done!

TIPS:
You can edit the name of the batchfile to anything you want, so if you want to can call it archey, screenfetch, maiwaifu, or anything else you can think of.
After the rename, instead of typing "winfetch" you would type what you renamed it to.

Special thanks go to Anonymous for  testing the 32bit version.

Have fun!
